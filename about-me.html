    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="first">My journey began when I grew up in New York City.  I went to college at the University of Stony Brook and after graduating, I moved to Los Angeles in 2002.</p> 
    
    <p class="second">For the past 14 years, I've been a Project Manager at a company called Efilm in Los Angeles. My primary duties there were to manage movie titles to completion focusing mainly in the areas of VFX, trailers, conforming, subtitling, coloring. The work was fast paced, with long hours, and under non-stop tremendously tight deadlines. But, to be able to work with some of the biggest filmmaking creative talent in the industry was an absolute pleasure.  I had a great time working on some of the top movies to have been released in the past 15 years. And I was lucky enough to have been surrounded by great co-workers with whom many have become very close friends over the years.</p>

    <p class="third">After 14 years in the movie world, it felt like time to move on to pursue other interests. Today I am a student of HTML at the University of Washington. My goal is to start a new career as a Front End Web Developer and am looking forward to all that I will learn in this class and future courses that will help me down this path.</p>

    <p class="fourth">I am proud of my past, but I am truly excited about what my future holds.</p>
